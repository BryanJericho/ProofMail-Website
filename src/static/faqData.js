    question: "What is ProofMail?",
    answer:

    question: "How does ProofMail work?",
    answer: `ProofMail works through a simple 3-step process:
      <ul>
        <li>Write your email as usual in Gmail.</li>
        <li>Connect your Phantom Wallet to authenticate</li>
        <li>Compose emails as usual - ProofMail automatically adds cryptographic signatures</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each signature is verified on the Solana blockchain for maximum security.</p>`,

    question: "Does ProofMail read my email content?",

    question: "Does ProofMail require blockchain transaction fees?",

  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Why do I need a Phantom Wallet?",
